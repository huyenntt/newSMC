              encapsulating Petri net-related functions in a C++ API
                        http://service-technology.org/pnapi


Version 4.02 (2010-07-28)
=========================

* made petri configurable (paths to external tools, configuration file)

* removed sa2sm and sa2owfn

* allowed parsing of Final Conditions only

* introduced method to guess place relations

* refactored interface classes (labels without a port will get their own
  ports)

* refactored compose according to the tpp glossar (i.e. two ports be
  composed iff they match perfectly)

* added parameter `--removePorts' to remove ports in output files (dot,
  owfn)

* using dot output, the final condition will now be written below the net

* removed bug with node IDs in dot output

Version 4.01 (2010-05-11)
=========================

* removed memory leak (thanks to wendy)

* implemented Woflan parser

* caged lexer and parser in classes (i.e. cleaned up global namespace)

* added a parameter `--guessFormula' to the frontend tool to guess the
  final condition from the structure of the net (i.e., use the sink place)

* added parameter `--canonicalNames' to rename nodes

Version 4.00 (2010-03-14)
=========================

* HEAVY INTERFACE CHANGES

* make check now tests, whether customer tools still work with the API (see
  `https://gna.org/task/?6813')

* added Makefile.am.customer for customer tools (will be generated by
  compiling the API)

* added make target for zcov

* copied parameter `--stats' from Wendy to Petri

* integrated `Output.*' and `verbose.*' to Petri (see
  `https://gna.org/task/?6837')

* reimplemented open net normalization function `normalize()') according to
  [LohmannMW_2007_icatpn]

* implemented PNML import and export based on the code of
  `http://www.w3.org/XML/9707/XML-in-C'

* added a utility that adds a configuration interface to a labeled Petri net

* added a utility that forms the final conditions in CDNF (see
  `https://gna.org/task/index.php?6845')

* added a utility that unfolds HL-oWFN to LL-oWFN (see
  `https://gna.org/task/index.php?6876')

* extended oWFN by role information (see
  `https://gna.org/task/index.php?6887')

* adapted scripts etc. to finally use the PNAPI as shared library

* added pnapi::version() to get PNAPI package string in customer tools

* introduced Interface class to handle input, output and synchronous labels

* added handle for verbose output

* rearranged exceptions

* fixed bug #14274: PNAPI: Memory leaks

* fixed bug #14856: PNAPI: Reduction by Starke rule #9 crashes under
  certain conditions

* fixed bug #14887: PNAPI: make check fails under MinGW

* fixed bug #15179: PNAPI: avoid using mktemp in Output.cc

* fixed bug #15415: PNAPI: Assertion failure when reducing net

Version 3.00 (2009-11-03)
=========================

* final condition can now be converted in disjunctive normal form

* added type getter to formula classes

* started proper versioning

* started proper documentation

* formulae now only concern internal places; only left wildcard is
  `ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY'

* fixed bug #14648: PNAPI: Shift/reduce conflict in `parser-pn.cc'

Version 2.00
============

* removed memory leaks

* integrated Output class from Wendy

* added make target "win32" to compile the api without linking against the
  cygwin1.dll

* added manpage for petri tool

* API can be compiled with foreign config.h (removed macro dependencies)

* added scripts to use LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to determine test case
  coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* new features:
     * Transition costs (https://gna.org/task/index.php?6615)

     * test cases and integration of new owfn parser
       (https://gna.org/task/index.php?6658)

     * Function to add a prefix to all places and transitions
       (https://gna.org/task/index.php?6749)

     * Integrate Genet for SA2ON conversion
       (https://gna.org/task/index.php?6767)

* fixed bugs:
     * PetriNet does not know Synchronous Labels of its transitions
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13936)

     * sa2sm/sa2owfn ignore synchronous labels
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13968)

     * Net reduction invalidates finalCondition and leads to core dump
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13969)

     * Composition of more than two nets fails because of prefixes to I/O
       places (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?13990)

     * No (public) method to remove nodes
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14003)

     * Removal of dead nodes also deletes interface place
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14064)

     * Arc weights to/from interface places are ignored by isNormal()
       function (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14116)

     * Normalization yields unequivalent nets
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14119)

     * No error when using SYNCHRONIZE with undeclared label in oWFN file
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14127)

     * LoLA-Parser is more strict than LoLA's parser
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14206)

     * synchronous steps become tau-transitions
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14335)

     * product with constraint does not work with synchronous communication
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14411)

     * When composing nets, costs of a transition get lost
       (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14417)

* further (undocumented) bugs fixed

* further (undocumented) changes

Version 1.1
===========

* implemented scanner and parser for oWFN files

* structural changes

* added formula class

* overworked reduction rules
     * murata rules will only be applied if the weight of all involved arcs
       is 1

     * some murata rules are extended by arc weights according to Thomas
       Pillat's proofs (see [pillat2008])

     * remaining rules have been deactivated

     * normalized nets can be kept normal

     * implemented new functions

     * findLivingTransition

     * calcSuccessorMarking

     * marking2Places

     * calcCurrentMarking

     * initMarking

     * isWorkflowNet

     * isFreeChoice

     * set and get methods for P, P_in, P_out, T and F

     * reevaluateType

     * isNormal

     * normalize

     * makeInnerStructure

     * set and get methods for invocation_string and package_string

* bugfixes
     * added missing "=NULL" after use of delete

     * searching for a place which has been removed or renamed won't cause
       a crash anymore

* added files
     * generic Doxygen configuration file

     * testcases

Version 1.0
===========

* copied api from fiona

* created Makefile.am and configure.ac for autotools usage

* it's compilable running autoreconf, configure and make
