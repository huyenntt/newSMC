@heading Version 4.02 (2010-07-28)
@itemize
@item made petri configurable (paths to external tools, configuration file)
@item removed sa2sm and sa2owfn
@item allowed parsing of Final Conditions only
@item introduced method to guess place relations
@item refactored interface classes (labels without a port will get their own ports)
@item refactored compose according to the tpp glossar (i.e. two ports be composed iff they match perfectly)
@item added parameter @option{--removePorts} to remove ports in output files (dot, owfn)
@item using dot output, the final condition will now be written below the net
@item removed bug with node IDs in dot output

@itemize
@item removed memory leak (thanks to wendy)
@item implemented Woflan parser
@item caged lexer and parser in classes (i.e. cleaned up global namespace)
@item added a parameter @option{--guessFormula} to the frontend tool to guess the final condition from the structure of the net (i.e., use the sink place)
