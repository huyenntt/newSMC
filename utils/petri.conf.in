# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Petri. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Petri needs Graphviz dot to generate pictures of Petri Nets.

# PNAPI needs to create a temporary file to pass it to Petrify. The filename
# PNAPI should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string. In case you use
# MinGW, path names are ignored and the basename is used instead.
