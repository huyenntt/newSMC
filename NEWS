              encapsulating Petri net-related functions in a C++ API
                        http://service-technology.org/pnapi


Version 4.02 (2010-07-28)
=========================

* made petri configurable (paths to external tools, configuration file)

* removed sa2sm and sa2owfn

* allowed parsing of Final Conditions only

* introduced method to guess place relations

* refactored interface classes (labels without a port will get their own
  ports)

* refactored compose according to the tpp glossar (i.e. two ports be
  composed iff they match perfectly)

* added parameter `--removePorts' to remove ports in output files (dot,
  owfn)

* using dot output, the final condition will now be written below the net

* removed bug with node IDs in dot output
