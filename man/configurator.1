.IP
When called without an input file, it is read from the standard input stream.
When called without an output parameter, no output file is created, but the
tool exits after configuration. If no filename is given, the input filename's
suffix (`.owfn') is replaced by the name of the respective option (e.g.,
`\-allow.owfn'). If the filename `\-' is given, the output will be piped to the
standard output stream.
